# Static Site Generator

This project uses python to convert markdown to html, and write files to a (for now) localhost server

## Useage

- From the root of the project:
  - ``` ./main.sh ```
  - you may need to run the command ``` chmod +x main.sh  ```
  - To customise the content write some valid markdown in the ``` content ``` directory which can be found in the root of the project

## Bugs

I'm sure my tests did not cover anything so if you find any bugs let me know, I'm always trying to learn more and improve!

Thanks!
